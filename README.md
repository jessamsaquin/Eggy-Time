# ðŸ¥š Egg Timer 

A simple egg timer built with HTML and JavaScript that helps you cook eggs perfectly. Choose between soft-boiled, medium-boiled, or hard-boiled, and the timer will count down to your desired cooking time. A cancel button resets the timer to 00:00.

## Features:
- **Soft-boiled Timer**: Set for 4 minutes, ideal for a runny yolk and slightly firm white.
- **Medium-boiled Timer**: Set for 7 minutes, perfect for a creamy yolk and firm white.
- **Hard-boiled Timer**: Set for 12 minutes, providing a fully cooked yolk and firm white.
- **Cancel Button**: Resets the timer to 00:00 at any point during the countdown, allowing you to start over.
- **Countdown Display**: Shows the time remaining in `mm:ss` format, updating every second for real-time feedback.
- **Alert Notification**: An alert will notify you once your egg is perfectly cooked and ready.
